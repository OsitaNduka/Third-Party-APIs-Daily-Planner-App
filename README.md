# Third-Party-APIs-Daily-Planner-App

## Description

This is a simple calender application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. I created the App using the skills I have learned so far, which requires me to think about DOM manipulation, advanced Javascript, integration of third-party APIs, Bootstrap, jQuery, moment.js and more.

The App displays the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner. It presents timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.

The App color-code each timeblock based on past, present and future when the timeblock is viewed. It allows the user to enter an event when they click a timeblock.

The App saves the event in the local storage when the the save button is clicked in that timeblock and persits events between refreshes of a page.




## Usage

This is an App that allows an employee with a busy shedule to add important events to a daily planner so that they can manage their time effectively.
