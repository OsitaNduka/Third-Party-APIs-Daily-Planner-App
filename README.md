# Third-Party-APIs-Daily-Planner-App

## Description

This is a simple calender application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. I created the App using the skills I have learned so far, which requires me to think about DOM manipulation, advanced Javascript, integration of third-party APIs, Bootstrap, jQuery, moment.js and more.
